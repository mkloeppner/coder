## Coder

Welcome to my coder blog on https://mkloeppner.github.io/coder/. As a developer with 10 years+ experience I stumbled across many various frameworks and technologies now as many of you. 

What I noticed is that there are tons of opportunities to learn from each other. Often frameworks solve the same issues in various ways. This diversity of languages, tools, and frameworks as well as the diversity of people and their mindsets is what creates true innovation from time to time.

This blog is about highlighting the overlooked nuances and differences from our dear beloved development communities.
We should engage and inspire each other rather than limiting the approaches just to our personal preference.

Humble and experienced developers value diversity and different thoughts, even if it's towards Apple or Microsoft ;).
